# BackEnd_API_MongoDB

The project builds a RESTful backend API using ASP.NET Core Web API, allowing basic user management operations such as creating, retrieving, 
deleting, and logging in users. User data is persistently stored in MongoDB instead of being temporarily held in memory. The API supports 
communication via standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE) and can be tested directly using Swagger UI or Postman.

This serves as a foundational step toward building a complete backend system, which can be extended to integrate with frontend frameworks 
like Angular or React, or be deployed in a real-world environment.
